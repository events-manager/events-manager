# Serverless Events API

## TODO's

- Connect API to a real database instead of static data
- Implement ACL and Authentication mechanisms
- Document the API and its usage

### Known issues

- Right now bufferutil and utf-8-validate are installed as dev dependencies, because on dev it 
complains about these deps missing. Not sure how to fix it yet.
